# FPGA Blinky Example.

This example demonstrates how to configure the FPGA on the S1 Module. The operations are:

1. Initialise the S1
1. Set IO and FPGA voltages
1. Erase the flash
1. Program the flash
1. Hand SPI control to FPGA and let it boot

The example is self documented. Important files are:

- `main.c` – Main nRF52 application for doing the above.
- `fpga_blinky.v` – Verilog code for blinking an LED.
- `Makefile` – Project makefile with build configuration.
